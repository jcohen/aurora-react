# Aurora React

Aurora UI prototype written using React/Flux (via Alt) and React Router.

This is just meant as a proof of concept to illustrate how a hypothetical Aurora React UI would be
structured, and how the Flux/Dispatcher pattern could be applied to the Aurora UI. It does not
attempt to actually talk to an Aurora Scheduler instance, but instead just uses mock data for the
single page where we render data.

## Basic Operation

The app requires node.js v0.12.x to run.

```shell
npm install
